# fLisp

fLisp is a tiny yet practical interpreter for a dialect of the Lisp
programming language. It is designed to be embeddable in applications
as extension language.

fLisp is embedded into the
[Femto](https://github.com/jorge-leon/femto) editor.

## Why the name fLisp

Lower case "f" stands for the femto metric prefix which represents
10^-15 — a very small number.  fLisp is meant to be very small.

Since "femtolisp" is already taken by a not so "femto" Lisp
interpreter, the choice fell on "fLisp".


## Goals of fLisp

- To be the smallest embeddable Lisp interpreter yet powerful enough
  to drive real world applications.
- To be rock stable, predictable and consistent.
- To consume as little resources as possible.
- To be easy to understand without extensive study [to encourage further
  experimentation].

## Building

fLisp only depends on the standard C libraries.

The default Makefile target:

    make all

creates:
- flisp .. The flisp command line utility.
- flispd .. The command line utility with floating point [double] support.
- libflisp.a and libflispd.a .. The libraries for embedding fLisp in other applications.

    make install

Installs the command line utilities, documentation and Lisp libraries.

    make install-dev

Installs the libraries, header files and pkg-config files.

	make deb

Builds the following Debian packages:

- `flisp` .. command line utilities.
- `flisp-common` .. Lisp libraries
- `flisp-doc` .. POSHdoc/HTML and Markdown documentation.
- `flisp-dev` ..  Development resources.

# Documentation

Extensive documentation is available in the `doc` directory in POSHdoc/HTML and Markdown format.
